Consumers:
Unlocking data

*****

This chapters covers  Exploring the consumer and how it works  Using consumer groups to coordinate reading data from topics  Learning about offsets and how to use them  Examining various configuration options that change consumer behavior

*****

Consumers get the data from Kafka and provide those values to other systems or applications.

*****

they can be written in various programming lan-guages just like producer clients.

*****

An example

*****

actual consumer processes can run on sepa-rate machines and are not required to run on a specific server.

*****

consumer is subscribing to topics (pulling messages) and not being pushed to instead? The power of processing control shifts to the consumer in this situation.

*****

Consumers themselves control the rate of consumption.

*****

not want to have your consumers down for extended periods.

*****

how data might be removed from Kafka due to size or time limits that users can define.

*****

5.1.1 Consumer options

*****

Table 5.1 Consumer configuration Key Purpose bootstrap.servers One or more Kafka brokers to connect on startup value.deserializer Needed for deserialization of the value key.deserializer Needed for deserialization of the key group.id A name that’s used to join a consumer group client.id An ID to identify a user (we will use this in chapter 10) heartbeat.interval.ms Interval for consumer’s pings to the group coordinator

*****

key names is to use the con-stants provided in the Java class ConsumerConfig (see http:/ /mng.bz/oGgy) and by looking for the Importance label of “high” in the Confluent website
