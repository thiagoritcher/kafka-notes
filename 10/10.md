“Protecting Kafka”

“discuss practical actions you can take in your own setup, and we will look at the client impact, as well as brokers and ZooKeeper, to make our cluster more secure.”

“This chapters covers  Security basics and related terminology  SSL between a cluster and clients  Access control lists (ACLs)  Network bandwidth and request rate quotas to limit demands on resources”

“The first part is how to encrypt our data.”

“next is how to find out who a person is in our system; not only who they are, but also making sure that the claimed identity of the user is verified”

“need to know what they are permitted do in our system.”

“not be able to derive the original content t”

““SSL” is the property name you will see in our examples and explanations even though TLS is the newer protocol version”

“authentication”

“Authorization,”

“what the user can do.”

“10.1.2 SSL between brokers and clients”

“One of our first steps is to create a key and certificate for our brokers [”

“keytool -genkey -noprompt \ -alias localhost \ -dname "CN=ka.manning.com,OU=TEST,O=TREASURE,L=Bend,S=Or,C=US" \ -keystore kafka.broker0.keystore.jks \ -keyalg RSA \ -storepass changeTreasure \ -keypass changeTreasure \ -validity 999”

“created a new key and stored it in the keystore file kafka.broker0.keystore.jks”

“Listing 10.1 SSL key generation for a broker”

“openssl req -new -x509 \ -keyout cakey.crt -out ca.crt \ -days 999 \ -subj '/CN=localhost/OU=TEST/O=TREASURE/L=Bend/S=Or/C=US' \ -passin pass:changeTreasure -passout pass:changeTreasure”

“listeners=PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092, ➥ SSL://localhost:9093 ssl.truststore.location= ➥ /opt/kafkainaction/private/kafka ➥ .broker0.truststore.jks ssl.truststore.password=changeTreasure ssl.keystore.location= ➥ /opt/kafkainaction/kafka.broker0.keystore.jks ssl.keystore.password=changeTreasure ssl.key.password=changeTreasure”

“Listing 10.2 Creating our own certificate authority”

“Listing 10.3 Broker server properties changes”

“Changes are also needed for our clients. For example, we set the value security .protocol=SSL, as well as the truststore location and password in a file called custom -ssl.properties.”

“bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9093 \ --topic kinaction_test_ssl \ --producer.config kinaction-ssl.properties”

“bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9093 \ --topic kinaction_test_ssl \ --consumer.config kinaction-ssl.properties”

“Limiting the ability to read as well as the ownership of the file is important to note before placing this configuration on your filesystem”

“10.1.3 SSL between brokers”

“security.inter.broker.protocol = SSL in the server properties if we do not want to continue using plaintext for communications between brokers”

“onsider a port change as well”

“10.2 Kerberos and the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)”

“Kerberos is often found in organizations as a method to provide single sign-on (SSO)”

“of Java”

“Listing 10.4 Using SSL configuration for command line clients”

“Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) files, which is a common file type for brokers and clients.”

“A keytab will likely be a separate file that has the principal and encrypted keys.”

“KafkaServer { ... keyTab="/opt/kafkainaction/kafka_server0.keytab" principal="kafka/kafka0.ka.manning.com@MANNING.COM"; };”

“listeners=PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092,SSL://localhost:9093, ➥ SASL_SSL://localhost:9094”

“Listing 10.8 ACL authorizer and superusers”

“Listing 10.9 Kafka ACLs to read and write to a topic”

“10.4 ZooKeeper”

“To help protect our metadata, we will need to set the value zookeeper .set.acl to true”

“zookeeper.properties configuration file,”

“Refer to http://mng.bz/Xr0v for more details if needed”

“10.5 Quotas”

“Listing 10.10 ZooKeeper ACLs”

“need to know how to identify who to limit and the limit we want to set.”

“10.5.1 Network bandwidth quota”

“In the following listing, we’ll limit the clients using the client ID kinaction _clueful by setting a producer_byte_rate and a consumer_byte_rate [13].”

“bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9094 --alter \ --add-config 'producer_byte_rate=1048576, ➥ consumer_byte_rate=5242880' \ --entity-type clients --entity-name kinaction_clueful”

“bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9094 --alter \ --delete-config ➥ 'producer_byte_rate,consumer_byte_rate' \ --entity-type clients --entity-name kinaction_clueful”

“The following is the order in which quotas are applied with the highest precedence listed at the top [14]:  User- and client.id-provided quotas  User quotas  client.id quotas”

“10.5.2 Request rate quotas”

“Listing 10.12 Listing and deleting a quota for client kinaction_clueful”

“You’ll find a formula that uses the number of I/O threads and the number of network threads at http://mng.bz/J6Yz [16]. I”

“10.6 Data at rest”

“ncrypt the data that Kafka writes to disk”

“10.6.1 Managed options”

“Amazon’s Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (https:// aws.amazon.com/msk/)”

“Confluent Cloud (https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/) also is an option”

“Listing 10.13 Creating a network bandwidth quota for client kinaction_clueful”

“Summary  Plaintext, although fine for prototypes, needs to be evaluated before production usage.  SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) can help protect your data between clients and brokers and even between brokers.  You can use Kerberos to provide a principal identity, allowing you to use Kerberos environments that already exist in an infrastructure.  Access control lists (ACLs) help define which users have specific operations granted. Role-based access control (RBAC) is also an option that the Confluent Platform supports. RBAC is a way to control access based on roles.  Quotas can be used with network bandwidth and request rate limits to protect the available resources of a cluster. These quotas can be changed and finetuned to allow for normal workloads and peak demand over time.”
