“Management: Tools and logging”

“This chapters covers  Scripting administration client options  Examining REST APIs, tools, and utilities  Managing Kafka and ZooKeeper logs  Finding JMX metrics  Advertised listeners and clients  Tracing using interceptors with headers”

“9.1 Administration clients”

“9.1.1 Administration in code with AdminClient”

“AdminClient class”

“ound in the share/ or libs/ directory of the Kafka installation”

“AdminClient highlights only a few common functions that are available at the time of writing”

“ Change configurations  Create/delete/list access control lists (ACLs)  Create partitions  Create/delete/list topics  Describe/list consumer groups  Describe clusters”

“9.1.2 kcat”

“especially when connecting remotely to your clusters.”

“kcat -P -b localhost:9094 \ -t kinaction_selfserviceTopic”

“Listing 9.3 Using a kcat producer”

“kcat -C -b localhost:9094 \ -t kinaction_selfserviceTopic”

“9.1.3 Confluent REST Proxy API”

“Listing 9.4 Using a kcat consumer”

“bin/kafka-rest-start.sh \ etc/kafka-rest/kafka-rest.properties”

“http:/./localhost :8082/topics”

“curl -X GET \ -H "Accept: application/vnd.kafka.v2+json" \ localhost:8082/topics”

“9.2 Running Kafka as a systemd service”

“Listing 9.5 Starting up a REST Proxy”

“A cURL call to the REST Proxy for a topic list”

“ExecStart=/opt/kafkainaction/bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh ➥ /opt/kafkainaction/config/zookeeper.properties ExecStop= /opt/kafkainaction/bin/zookeeper-server-stop.sh Restart=on-abnormal”

“sudo systemctl start zookeeper sudo systemctl start kafka”

“9.3 Logging”

“9.3.1 Kafka application logs”

“Kafka has multiple log files that we might be interested in or need to access for troubleshooting”

“Listing 9.7 ZooKeeper unit file”

“Listing 9.8 Kafka startup with systemctl”

“log4j.appender.kafkaAppender.MaxFileSize=500KB log4j.appender.kafkaAppender.MaxBackupIndex=10”

“Listing 9.9 Kafka server log retention”

“kafkaAppender server.log stateChangeAppender state-change.log requestAppender kafka-request.log cleanerAppender log-cleaner.log controllerAppender controller.log authorizerAppender kafka-authorizer.log”

“Changes to the log4j.properties file require the broker to be restarted”

“9.3.2 ZooKeeper logs”

“autopurge.purgeInterval”

“autopurge.snapRetainCount”

“snapCount”

“9.4 Firewalls”

“Kafka brokers can listen”

“default for a plain text port is 9092”

“An SSL port at 9093 can also be set up on that same host”

“ZooKeeper includes port 2181”

“9.4.1 Advertised listeners”

“listeners versus advertised.listeners”

“initial connection from the client uses the information that is located in the Kafka listeners”

“What it gives back to the client to connect to next is the data in Kafka’s advertised .listeners”

“An important setting to look at is inter.broker.listener.name”

“article by Robin Moffatt, “Kafka Listeners – Explained,””

“9.5 Metrics”

“9.5.1 JMX console”

“VisualVM (https://visualvm.github.io/) is one example”

“MBeans Browser”

“export JMX_PORT=49999”

“KAFKA_JMX_OPTS”

“KAFKA_JMX_OPTS="-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=127.0.0.1 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.local.only=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=49999 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false"”

“Listing 9.10 Kafka JMX options”

“9.6 Tracing option”

“By adding an interceptor on both the producer and consumer clients that we are using, we can”

“separate the monitoring logic from the application logic. The crosscutting concern of monitoring can, hopefully, be more encapsulated by this approach.”

“9.6.1 Producer logic”

“Java interface ProducerInterceptor.”

“ew class called AlertProducerMetricsInterceptor”

“public class AlertProducerMetricsInterceptor implements ProducerInterceptor<Alert, String>”

“kaProperties.put("interceptor.classes", AlertProducerMetricsInterceptor.class.getName());”

“9.6.2 Consumer logic”

“public class AlertConsumerMetricsInterceptor implements ConsumerInterceptor<Alert, String>”

“Listing 9.12 AlertProducer with interceptor configuration”

“Listing 9.13 The alert interceptor output”

“Listing 9.14 AlertConsumerMetricsInterceptor example”

“kaProperties.put("interceptor.classes", AlertConsumerMetricsInterceptor.class.getName());”

“9.6.3 Overriding clients”

“Listing 9.15 AlertConsumer with interceptor configuration”

“Brave, it is a library meant to help add instrumentation for distributed tracing.”

“If interested, please take a peek at the TracingConsumer class (http:// mng.bz/6mAo)”

“final class KInActionCustomConsumer<K, V> implements Consumer<K, V>”

“9.7 General monitoring tools”

“Yammer Metrics library [17]. This library is used to provide JMX metrics on various parts of the application,”

“Listing 9.16 Custom consumer client”

“CMAK (https://github.com/yahoo/ CMAK), once known as the Kafka Manager,”

“Cruise Control (https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control) was created by developers at LinkedIn.”

“Confluent Control Center (https://docs.confluent.io/current/control-center/ index.html) is another web-based”

“Overall, Kafka provides us with many options to not only manage but also monitor our cluster”

“Summary  Besides the shell scripts that are packaged with Kafka, an administrative client also exists to provide API access to important tasks such as creating a topic.  Tools such as kcat and the Confluent REST Proxy API allow ways for developers to interact with the cluster.  Although Kafka uses a log for client data at its core, there are still various logs specific to the operation of the broker that we need to maintain. We need to address managing these logs (and ZooKeeper logs) to provide details for troubleshooting when needed.  Understanding advertised listeners can help explain behavior that at first appears inconsistent for client connections.  Kafka uses JMX for metrics. You can see metrics from clients (producers and consumers) as well as from brokers.  We can use producer and consumer interceptors to implement crosscutting concerns. One such example would be adding tracing IDs for monitoring message delivery.”
